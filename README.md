# Rubik
This is my attempt in learning WebGPU, specifically `wgpu` by creating a 3D animated rubik

# Steps
You can follow the progress by tracking release tags:
- Draw a triangle
- Creating a cube
- Draw many cubes, animate them
- Adding lights
- Manipulate object transformation to archive rubik rotating mechanic 

# Final result
